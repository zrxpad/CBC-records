CBC — Comprehensive background check


This section will thoroughly cover what a CBC is, How it works, what it covers, how it applies to projects, layout for evaluation and how to apply for one?


CBC (Comprehensive Background check)
Our comprehensive background check (CBC) will introduce a new standard for a KYC where the whole team and project is evaluated and rated with a score out of 100 much like a Audit report with the following weighted contributions being as follows:

40% Idea and Viability
The projects and underlying ideas will be evaluated by uniqueness of concept, white paper strength, likelihood of completing the roadmap and promises made with their resources available, and other varying factors that will be custom to the each and every project.

30% Team and background
We will rate the teams on their background in (Deployer wallets of past projects, past project evidence and ATH verifications) and outside (Linked in profiles, company registrations, proof of past employment) of crypto with sufficient evidence provided to pass, in addition to the normal KYC procedure by a 1 hour long video call and other complimentary verification procedures.

30% Social presence and Hype factor
The social presence and hype factor will also be evaluated across all channels and community presence will also strongly be taken into account when giving a score to the projects as this is a crucial factor of many projects success not to mention too many but Shiba Inu, Bitcoin, Safemoon being some solid examples of what can happen when a community really gets behind a project!

…

And so with the introduction of the CBC standard we do the due diligence so you don’t have to. Now you can easily participate in top tier projects and not have to think before aping an investment.

In the coming days we will be carrying out a few CBCs with some top notable projects that have hit 2023 by storm to expand on and show the analysis flow with the records being posted on our website and GitHub followingly.
